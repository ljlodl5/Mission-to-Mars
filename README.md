# Mission-to-Mars

## **Overview**
The support provided in this repository represents a webscraping exercise utilizing beautiful soup, noSql Mongodb image scraping, flask connection and local html visualization.
While the task in Jupyter worked as expected, the index html either via bad code or firewall issues (or a combination of both) the Mars Hemispheres would not display.
